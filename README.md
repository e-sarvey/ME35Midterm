# ME35Midterm
Welcome to my GitHub repository for my ME-35: Intro to Robotics midterm assignment.
To see all the details about what the project entailed and how I completed it check out my notion page: https://www.notion.so/Midterm-Reading-the-Temperature-plus-some-8a9a66b3cea440bfb427b6d7f3f0bd2e?pvs=4

The image processing part of the assignment was done using a PyScript page which can be found here: https://esarvey.pyscriptapps.com/me35-midterm-copy/latest/ 
My professor created the HTML outline and some underlying python functions, and I added my code to the repl and saved it in the HTML so when the page loads you can see the code I added. This program detects the most prominent rgb channel of the largest item placed in the frame and updates an Airtable database with that color.
